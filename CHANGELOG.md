# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Compositor depth: workspaces + context types, move-window-to-workspace,
  switch-workspace, secure + agent-aware modes, window-at-point hit-testing.
- Renderer depth: alpha blend (`rend_blend`) + damage tracking (bounding-box
  `DamageTracker`).
- Ported `shell_integration` + `plugin_host` — completes all 8 M2 leaf modules.
- Behavioral parity test suites for all 8 leaf modules (~670 assertions, all green).

### Changed

- Deferred `mehman` / `agnostik` / `agnodrm` from the active build (mapping kept in
  `cyrius.cyml` comments). All are unused today and their full `dist` bundles break
  the build: `cyrius build` prepends every `[deps.*]` module, and mehman→`[deps.kavach]`
  drags in the HTTP/`thread_local` surface (`sandhi_server_*`) as reachable-undefined,
  while agnostik+agnodrm collide on `ERR_*`. **bhumi is the only active dep** (clean,
  no git sub-deps). Re-enable with selective `modules = [...]` when consumed.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-07-02 — Cyrius port

First release of the Cyrius incarnation of aethersafha. The prior Rust crate is
frozen at `rust-old/` as the parity oracle (see the pre-port baseline below).

### Changed

- **Ported Rust → Cyrius via `cyrius port`.** The 27,207-line Rust tree moved to
  `rust-old/` (frozen parity oracle); the project is now a Cyrius crate pinned to
  toolchain 6.3.35 in `cyrius.cyml`.
- **Replaced the Wayland platform stack with sovereign AGNOS backends**: bhumi
  0.7.0 (platform I/O — DRM/KMS + libinput + logind → `output`/`input`/`seat`),
  mehman 0.1.0 (foreign-surface hosting — the XWayland successor, post-MVP).
  Native Wayland protocol dispatch stays in aethersafha proper.
- **Dependency mapping**: `agnostik` → agnostik 1.3.2 (Cyrius); `agnosys` →
  agnodrm 1.4.4 (agnosys decomposed 2026-06-19, device model → agnodrm);
  GPU (`mabda`) deferred — software renderer is the v1.0 path.

### Added

- Foundational compositor base on the bhumi seam: `geom`, `window`, `compositor`,
  `render` (software renderer over the bhumi XRGB framebuffer), `input`
  (bhumi HID → actions), and a `main` frame loop. Compiles + runs.
- M2 leaf-module parity batch (structural parity vs `rust-old/`, prefixed symbols,
  compiling + smoke-tested): `theme_bridge`, `gestures`, `accessibility`,
  `ai_features`, `shell`, `security_ui`.
- `tests/aethersafha.tcyr` (21 core assertions) + `tests/leaf_modules.tcyr`
  (11 leaf-coexistence assertions) — 32 green.
- Parity roadmap (`docs/development/roadmap.md`) mapping every Rust module to its
  Cyrius target, backend binding, and milestone (M1–M5).
- Toolchain pin advanced to 6.3.36.

### Notes

- Structural parity for the M2 leaf batch (compiles + smoke-tested); deeper
  behavioral parity tests against `rust-old/` are the next increment.
- Known: agnostik + agnodrm both bundle the shared `ERR_*` module → benign
  duplicate-symbol warnings ("last wins"). See roadmap "Known cleanup".

## Pre-port Rust baseline - 2026-04-01

_Not a Cyrius release — the extracted Rust crate that the 0.1.0 Cyrius port
targets for parity. Source frozen at `rust-old/`._

- Initial extraction from `agnosticos/userland/desktop-environment/`
- Wayland compositor with backend abstraction (`WaylandBackend`)
- AI desktop features — context-aware suggestions, agent HUD
- Desktop shell — app launcher, notifications, quick settings
- Renderer — scene graph, damage tracking, decorations, high-contrast
- Accessibility — AccessibilityTree, tab navigation, announcements
- Plugin host — sandboxed plugin loading, capability system
- XWayland manager — surface mapping, property translation
- Shell integration — tray, window management, notification bridge
- Theme bridge — AGNOS→Flutter ThemeData, platform channel
- Desktop applications — web browser, file manager, terminal, model manager
- Screen capture — per-agent permissions, rate limiting, PNG/BMP/raw encoding
- Screen recording — frame-by-frame, poll-based streaming, ring buffer
- Security UI — permission dialogs, threat alerts, agent dashboard
- Gesture recognition system
- HUD overlays — crew status, domain filter, GPU status
- Criterion benchmarks for compositor and screen capture
